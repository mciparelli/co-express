## Usage

**co-express** lets you write your express routes by using generator functions as middlewares.
Like this:

```js
var fs = require('co-fs');
var express = require('express');
var wrapper = require('co-express');

var app = wrapper(express());

app.get('/', function *(req, res) {
  var packageContents = yield fs.readFile('./package.json', 'utf8');
  res.send(packageContents);
});

app.listen(8000);
```

You can also define multiple generator functions just the [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) way:

```js
app.get('/users', function *(req, res, next) {
  req.users = yield db.getUsers();
  next();
}, function *(req, res) {
  res.send(req.users);
});
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install co-express
```
